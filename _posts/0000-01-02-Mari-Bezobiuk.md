. Start With a Purpose
The introduction to your SRS is very important. 
It sets the expectation for the product you’re building.

So, start by defining the purpose of your product.

Intended Audience and Intended Use
Define who in your organization will have access to the SRS — 
and how they should use it. This may include developers, testers, 
and project managers. It could also include stakeholders in other departments, 
including leadership teams, sales, and marketing.

Product Scope
Describe the software being specified. And include benefits, objectives, and goals.
This should relate to overall business goals, especially if teams outside of 
development will have access to the SRS.

Definitions and Acronyms
It’s smart to include a risk definition. Avoiding risk is top-of-mind for many 
developers — especially those working on safety-critical development teams.

Here’s an example. If you’re creating a medical device, the risk might be 
the device fails and causes a fatality.

By defining that risk up front, it’s easier to determine the specific
requirements you’ll need to mitigate it.
